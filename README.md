pi3d_demos
==========

Demos and support files for pi3d (3D graphics python package for the
raspberry pi)

In order to run these demos you need to have pi3d. You should look at
pi3d.github.io/html/index.html for instructions on install and using it.

The zip file is currently about 28MB and unzips to about 40MB of which
a small number of large files used in ConferenceHall, Triceratops, Silo,
TigerTank and Jukebox contribute half.
